I'm interested in taking DATA602 because I think it will help me expand my knowledge in data science, especially in terms of discovering new data management and analysis tools. During my prior employment, I was only allowed to use IBPL, a proprietary program that integrated Python and SQL for data analysis. Under the direction of Professor Fardina Alham, I hope to broaden my expertise in this course by learning new tools like GitHub and Git, which will improve my capacity to work with others on projects and do data analysis more effectively. Additionally, I'm eager to learn about data modeling, data cleaning, and structured data management strategies.
